                         The conversion to the new way of doing things should bestraightforward though.

          o Table pagination. When turned on (by setting the -fs-table-pagination property to paginate
            vs. a default of auto ), tables and table cells will be closed (with appropriate borders and
            padding) when a page ends and reopened when a page starts. Additionally, a table's thead and
            tfoot will be repeated on each page.

          o Named pages
          o Running elements

            elements]
          o Pseudo-elements may now be specified with a double colon
          o Substring selectors
          o The background property can now be used in a @page context – CSS 3 spec
          o Custom property to limit the scope of the page and pages counters to a portion of the document
          o Custom property that instructs FS to try to avoid breaking a box so that only borders and padding
            appear on a page
