Why ParadoxPDF?
---------------

I Love eZ Publish. As you know PDF support is deprecated. So we need a handy way to serve content as PDF files.

ParadoxPDF uses a java jar : paradoxpdf.jar built upon 'Flying Saucer' https://xhtmlrenderer.dev.java.net/
Flying saucer is a XML/XHTML/CSS 2.1 Renderer that supports a native PDF output support.

Paradoxpdf.jar is a wrapper application that can be used from command line. Is contains all dependencies.
and sources will be soon published on sourcefoge.net

The original idea for using 'Flying Saucer' to generate pdf contents was published by Joshua Marinacci to
http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/06/26/generating-pdfs-with-flying-saucer-and-itext.html



ParadoxPDF features
-------------------

ParadoxPDF provides all features of Flying Saucer as :

    * Platform independent : 100% Java XML+CSS layout engine with native PDF output.
    * Strong support for the CSS 2.1 specification including extensions to better support paged media.
    * Support for XHTML.
    * Arbitrary elements may be replaced with custom content.
    * Some support for PDF specific features (for example, bookmarks and internal links). More coming soon.

In addition :
    * Easy : Prepare your designs just as any html design for the PDF View and let the magic happen
    * Multipage generation and page break-support (with custom header and footer)
    * Good performance (better than Apache FOP).
    * Cache : You can manage PDF caches as template cache-blocks look doc/doc.txt (cluster compatible)
